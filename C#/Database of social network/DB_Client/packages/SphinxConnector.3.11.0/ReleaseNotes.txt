---------------------------------------
SphinxConnector.NET 3.11.0 Release Notes
---------------------------------------

Fluent API: When accessing nested JSON objects, the path was not correctly resolved.

Fluent API: Any/All/Contains could not be used with a the value of a Dictionary entry, because the required
cast to the appropriate collection type wasn't handled correctly.

Fluent API: Added public method Get() to ConnectionStringConfigurator which returns the configured
connection string, as it might be useful for logging/debugging purposes.

Fluent API: Added support for PACKEDFACTORS().

Fluent API: When using In() in Select() with a string argument, the string wasn't wrapped in a parameter during translation to SphinxQL.

General: Added ReSharper annotations.

SphinxQL/FluentAPI: Updated the Sphinx version string parser, now that Sphinx has moved to Git. Before, the Sphinx version string would
contain the SVN revision, which SphinxConnector.NET used (in addition to the version) to determine Sphinx capabilities
(and certain quirks). Starting from 2.2.10, only the version will be used, previous versions build with the SVN revision
will be treated as before, i.e. the SVN revision will be taken into account.
