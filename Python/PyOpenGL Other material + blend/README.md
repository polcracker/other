# PyOpenGL

This simple program showing the operation of OpenGL in Python. 
The program draws a funny face (3 teapots + sphere) and Hammer 
(Cylinder + Octahedron). Write up these objects in different compositions and 
are rendered differently. draw_compose_1() - the simple call, 
draw_compose_2() - used to access a list of objects.
In the future we plan to explore PyOpenGL little wider.
