# The solution of logical problems

ABOUT
-----

Visual Prolog 5.2

This simple project demonstrates the operation of logic programming in 
solving logical problems. Through the mechanism of backtracking 
(Returns with a bust) and there we find a solution of the current problem.

The challenge formed by the type of reflection of the problem in Prolog 
predicates.


Auditor 1 - Yeromosh CEELI-Hamosh

Auditor 2 - Kazmer Kish Kiral

Auditor 3 - Lola Latsathi

PROBLEMS
--------

"REVISION"

On Saturday morning, the board of the production association "Cakes and retort"
 discussed the question of the mission staff for the next week. It was 
necessary to send auditors to the three companies included in the consolidation
 and are located in the villages of Upper Bolshegrad, Lower Malograd and 
Plutograd. Each examiner had to leave one day in the first half of next week 
(Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday) and examine the state of affairs in the company 
of one of the three villages. Conduct an audit commissioned Yeromoshu 
CEELI-Hamoshu, Kazmer Kish chiral and Lola Latsathi. In any of the days on a 
business trip can go only one auditor, as the board of the production 
association "Cakes and retort" experiencing an acute shortage of skilled 
workers counting. Naturally, the question arises as to what children whom 
and where to send. Solve it proved difficult. The views expressed in this 
respect differing views were as follows:

1) a colleague CEELI-Hamosh does not want to go to Lower Malograd, because 
the last time he was there, he had to eat lunch in the canteen;

2) a colleague Kish Kiral no objection to go to the revision in the lower 
Malograd and Upper Bolshegrad, but it fits any day except Tuesday because 
of his experience, he knows that on Tuesdays in the restaurants of these 
settlements is very limited selection of dishes;

3) counterpart Kish Kiral resolutely refuses to travel to Upper Bolshegrad 
if it will have on Monday, because the last time with him respectfully enough 
cost doorman at the restaurant of the Upper Bolshegrada, always on duty on 
Mondays;

4) With regard to the Lower Malograda, in this village have not expressed a 
desire to go to any of Auditors, because it closed on Mondays all businesses 
trust restaurant;

5) counterpart CEELI-Hamosha better not to send the Upper Bolshegrad because 
he does not use it due authority (during the last revision, he cut a poor 
figure: failed to distinguish the cake from the retort);

6) counterpart CEELI-Hamosha can in good conscience send a mission to 
Plutograd, but he asked to appoint an audit, if possible, on any day, 
except Monday, as it has a special reason, which he would not like to 
mention, makes for He traveled to Plutograd Monday junk. 

Can I make a schedule trips to meet all the requirements of government and 
fulfill all the wishes of Auditors?
